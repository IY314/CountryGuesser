# Country Guessing Game
Uh yea. A country guessing game because I'm a huge nerd and memorized most of the 195 countries of the world.

## Premise
The premise of the game is to guess all 195 countries in the world. There are some alternate names for countries, but I will try to keep the list updated. There is a progress bar, a percentage, and the number of countries guessed on top.

If you enter an unknown country, the game is over (but I am planning to add something to make it more fun).

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/IY314/CountryGuesser.git
cd CountryGuesser
make
```
